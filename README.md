========================================================

This project aims to clean the UCI HAR Dataset. 

The script **run_analysis.R** will take the original dataset as input and generate two tidy data sets.

To run this script, please set the current working directory as where the folder "UCI HAR Dataser" is.

After running this script, two tidy datasets named as "tidyData.txt" and "tidyMeanData.txt" will be generated in the current working directory.

For more information about the script and generated datasets, please check the **CodeBook**.
